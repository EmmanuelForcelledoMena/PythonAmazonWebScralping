This repository contains Python scripts for web scraping Amazon data. Below are the details of each script:

## Amazon Web Scraping Single Product.py

This script (`Amazon Web Scraping Single Product.py`) extracts information from a single product on Amazon. Additionally, it implements a system that notifies you of a price update based on a specific parameter.

## Amazon Web Scraping Multiple Pages.py

The script (`Amazon Web Scraping Multiple Pages.py`) extracts the product name, star ratings, number of reviews, and price from all available pages on Amazon for the product you specify.

Please refer to the individual script files for more detailed information on their functionality and how to use them.

Feel free to explore the scripts, and don't hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or suggestions.

Thank you for your interest in my project!
